I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Chicago. I study Genetics and Genomics. My work focuses on using natural human variation to understand how the genome works. I am interested in pursuing a career in law in order to fasciliate responsible conduct of research and the effective implementation of new genomics technologies into society. Outside of work, I enjoy swinging on the flying trapeze and cheering for the Duke University Blue Devils!
